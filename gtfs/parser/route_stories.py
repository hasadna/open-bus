Route stories: what they are and what they are good for

Background:
An intuitive model for a public transport would include the following objects:

* A bus line (e.g. bus line 189). In the GTFS this is called Route. The GTFS routes table has 
  separate records for each direction and alternative (halufa).
* A trip (e.g. 189 leaving terminal X on 2016-06-29 at 13:55). In practice most trips
  repeat every week or even every day. To reduce duplicates, a trip record in the GTFS doesn't 
  have a single date, but a start & end date and days of week.
* For each trip we would need the list of stops, and the arrival time to each stop. For example
  the Sunday 8:55 trip of 189, starts at stop X at time 8:55, arrive at stop Y at 8:56, arrives
  at stop z at 8:58 etc. This is implemented in the GTFS is stop_times table. 
  
What's the problem?
Since every trip has its own list of stops, the GTFS allow each trip of a route to be different.
So 189 of 8:55 could go from Tel-Aviv to Holon and 189 of 9:06 can go from Petah-Tikva to Azor.

In pracrice in Israel, each bus line has a fixed route (stop sequence). If a bus line has two 
routes (e.g. some trips go through a certain neighborhood and others don't) - the line will 
have to separate route records (halufot). The only reason for two different stop sequences
is if during the two months covered by the GTFS, there is a planned changed in the route
(so one stop sequence will be valid say until June 30th, and then a different starting July 1st).

And it gets better:

Not only the stop sequence is fixed, the arrival times to each stop are fixed. That is,
if the 08:00 trip arrives at stop x at 8:19, the 13:00 trip will arrive at stop x at 13:19.
There is not effort to publish (or probably even plan) a reasonable schedule that 
takes into account peak traffic.

Here comes in a new object, Route Story. A route story is a list of stops, and the time offset
of the arrival to the stop, compared to the beginning of the route.

E.g.:

    stop_times				route_story
    stop 1, 8:15			stop 1, 0
    stop 2, 8:27			stop 2, 12 minutes
    stop 3, 8:29			stop 3, 14 minutes
    ....					....

Every trip has a route story, and a start time:

    trip1:   stop 1, 8:15; stop 2, 8:27; stop 3, 8:29 ....
    trip2:   stop 1, 8:35; stop 2, 8:47; stop 3, 8:49 ....

becomes:
    route story 1:	stop 1, 0; stop 2, 12 minutes; stop 3, 14 minutes ...
    trip1: route_story 1, start_time  8:15
    trip2: route_story 2, start_time  8:35

Why is this good?
    - it saves a lot of space, and saves loading time if you need to analyse all the trips.
    - it makes logical sense, and makes it easy to examine the changes in route stories per route.
